# Custom Prompt Generation Modules

**Description**: Generate custom prompts tailored to the user's query by filtering and selecting the most pertinent data from existing data chunks.

**Example Prompt**:
- **Original**: "What are the benefits of meditation?"
- **Optimized**: "List the benefits of meditation, using data from recent clinical studies published in the last five years."

## Detailed Explanation

Custom Prompt Generation Modules are designed to create prompts that are highly relevant to the specific needs of the user by leveraging existing data in a structured manner. This technique ensures that the AI's responses are accurate, relevant, and based on the most pertinent information available.

### How It Works

1. **Data Chunk Generation**:
   - Convert structured data (e.g., tables, databases) into sentence and paragraph formats to create "data chunks".
   - These chunks are stored hierarchically to support efficient querying and retrieval.

2. **Filtering and Selection**:
   - For each user query, the most relevant data chunks are selected based on the query's context and requirements.
   - A customized ranking mechanism is employed to filter for the "most similar" data chunks.

3. **Custom Prompt Creation**:
   - Assemble a prompt that includes the most relevant data chunks, key definitions, and a sample question and answer format.
   - Ensure that the prompt covers all aspects necessary to generate an accurate and relevant response.

### Benefits

- **Relevance**: Ensures that responses are directly related to the user's query.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces the risk of hallucinations by grounding responses in relevant, factual data.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the prompt generation process, making it faster and more scalable.

### Example Use Case

**Original User Query**: "What are the benefits of meditation?"

**Data Chunks**:
- Clinical study on meditation's impact on stress reduction.
- Research article on meditation and mental health.
- Summary of benefits from a health and wellness website.

**Optimized Prompt**: 
"List the benefits of meditation, using data from recent clinical studies published in the last five years. Include findings from studies on stress reduction, mental health improvement, and overall wellness."

### Implementation Tips

- **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that data is preprocessed and categorized effectively to facilitate quick retrieval.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Use dynamic filtering algorithms to adapt to different types of queries and user needs.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the data chunks updated with the latest information to maintain accuracy and relevance.

By using Custom Prompt Generation Modules, you can significantly enhance the quality of AI-generated responses, making them more useful and trustworthy for users across various domains.
